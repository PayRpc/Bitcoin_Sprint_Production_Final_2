// Execute protected operation
result, err := cb.ExecuteWithContext(ctx, func() (interface{}, error) {
    return bitcoinService.ProcessTransaction(tx)
})

// Monitor and respond to result
if result.Success {
    log.Info("Transaction processed successfully")
} else {
    log.Warn("Transaction failed", "type", result.FailureType)
}
```
