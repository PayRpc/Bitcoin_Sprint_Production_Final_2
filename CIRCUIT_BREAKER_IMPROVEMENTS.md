# Circuit Breaker Algorithm Improvements

## Summary of Improvements

We've successfully refactored and improved the circuit breaker algorithms in the Bitcoin Sprint project. The key improvements include:

1. **ExponentialBackoff**
   - Fixed jitter application to only apply to the returned delay values, not compounding with the base delay
   - Separated the internal state progression from the jittered output
   - Added proper bounds checking to ensure delays never exceed the maximum

2. **SlidingWindow**
   - Improved bucket rotation to handle multiple steps at once when there's a long gap between updates
   - Added proper initialization of buckets with appropriate timestamps
   - Improved statistics aggregation with proper time-based filtering

3. **AdaptiveThreshold**
   - Enhanced with configurable bounds relative to the base threshold
   - Improved trend calculation and threshold adjustment logic
   - Added proper clamping to keep thresholds within sensible ranges

4. **LatencyDetector**
   - Properly tracks timestamps for each latency measurement
   - Improved pruning of data outside the detection window
   - Enhanced detection algorithm with proper percentage-based triggers

5. **HealthScorer**
   - Reimplemented with target-based scoring that properly scales with system performance
   - Improved weighting system for different health metrics
   - Better normalization of values to ensure consistent health scores

6. **Helper Functions**
   - Added proper percentile calculation with linear interpolation and bounds checking
   - Implemented utility functions like `clamp01` and `maxFloat` for robust algorithm implementation

## Testing

We've created comprehensive unit tests for each algorithm to verify correct behavior:

- Tests for ExponentialBackoff verify proper delay calculation and jitter strategies
- Tests for SlidingWindow ensure proper bucket rotation and statistics aggregation
- Tests for AdaptiveThreshold confirm proper threshold adjustment based on performance trends
- Tests for LatencyDetector validate correct identification of latency issues
- Tests for HealthScorer verify accurate health score calculation under various conditions

## Infrastructure Improvements

We've added several improvements to support better testing and code organization:

- Added `Clock` interface to allow deterministic time-based testing
- Added `RNG` interface to enable deterministic randomization for testing
- Consolidated algorithm implementations in `algorithms.go`
- Created separate type definitions to avoid duplication
- Enhanced documentation for all algorithms

## Next Steps

To further improve the circuit breaker implementation, consider:

1. Adding metrics collection for algorithm performance
2. Implementing adaptive parameter tuning based on system behavior
3. Adding more sophisticated health scoring based on additional metrics
4. Enhancing observability with detailed logging of algorithm decisions
5. Implementing better error tracking and categorization

These improvements make the circuit breaker algorithms more robust, predictable, and maintainable while also improving their effectiveness at protecting the system during failures.
